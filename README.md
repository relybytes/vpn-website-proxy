# Architecture

This section should help the developer to understand how the project works physically
In this section, it helps a lot to have an image or a graph (made for example using a mermaid) that helps to understand quickly the context and how it interacts with the real world

# Repository

This section should explain how the repository is structured, also at the code level (classes/folders).
Also any links to other repositories (submodules).

This is a basic structure:
* **folder1** -> this folder contains ...

The folders obviously must be present if they are needed (if for example there are no scripts, the folder will not be present either)

# Installation

The following information must be present:
- physical requirements of the machine to carry out the project 
- application requirements (dependencies) with the specific versions 
- steps to install the development environment and be ready to program 

In addition, there must be information about the recommended IDE/Tools needed or recommended to use

# Build

The commands and steps to perform the build of the package, to be released, must be present in this section

# Run
